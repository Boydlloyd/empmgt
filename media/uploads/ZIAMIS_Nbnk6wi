Dear Mr Njorope,
I hope all is well with you.
Dr Phiri has not been feeling too well for the past 2days, 
so he has asked me to follow up on two issues concerning ZIAMIS.
1. Failing of Redeeming of e-vouchers balances 
2. Generation of Invoices for Insurance Redeeming to facilitate payment process for recommended Agro-dealers.
